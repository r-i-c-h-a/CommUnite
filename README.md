# CommUnite
Design Process of our web app - CommUnite as a part of the Human Computer Interaction Course - Fall 2020 PES University

We have created CommUnite to help people new to the city. CommUnite's goal is to help you with your day to day needs and activities. It also offers a platform where you can reach out to and connect with other people of the community with similar interests as yours and keep abreast of the ongoing events in the city. Everyone faces problems in a society as complex as ours and hence CommUnite offers a one-stop solution for your problems. With a large user base and CommUnite as a platform, you can raise issues and ask queries about anything and everything!

Our design process is as follows:
1. <b> Needfinding </b> - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d2SXJRXb15349JHwtUO17sQEj7By-H2t/view <br>
We started our project by brainstorming on the domain we will be focussing on. We finally settled on our user group being people who moved into Bangalore from around the world. We interviewed and empathized with three people from varied age groups to get more holistic insights. Upon gathering the insights, we unpacked them into empathy maps to find a common ground where the needs of all age groups lie.

2. Low Fidelity Prototype - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1O2HjjyQSYI3SWFWU_c8db9Fi_wAt7PbS/view?usp=sharing <br>
For the low-fi prototype, we made rough sketches of UIs with different layouts, to iteratively develop a UI that was easy to navigate for the user, while also providing all relavant information.

3. High Fidelity Prototype - https://github.com/sharanyavenkat25/CommUnite/blob/main/home.html <br>
Using HTML/CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap and PHP we built a web app targeted for the various devices like mobile, tablets and desktops. In this prototype, a user has a complete hands-on experience of all deliverables promised.

4. Concept Video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfG6zVTiVOE <br>
We brainstormed ideas about how a user could interact with our product and came up with some preliminary design ideas. Over the course of a week, we shot and edited a concept video which tentatively illustrates why our product is needed and how a user would use it on a high-level.
